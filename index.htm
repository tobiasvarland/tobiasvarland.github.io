              <p class="font-weight-light">
                Finding the right second shooter can be difficult. Here are some reasons why I believe
                you may want to hire me:
              </p>
              <ol class="font-weight-light">
                <li>
                  <strong class="font-weight-bold">I'm experienced.</strong><br>
                  I previously ran my own business and I've done wedding photography for well over 100
                  weddings and wedding videography for well over 50 weddings. I have experience
                  shooting solo, shooting as part of a husband and wife team, and second shooting
                  for a variety of other photographers and videographers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong class="font-weight-bold">I'm professional.</strong><br>
                  Having run my own business in the past, I understand what your wedding
                  photography business means to you and I know my role as a second shooter.
                  I dress in an understated but professional manner. I interact with guests
                  and other vendors in a polite and kind manner. I take my role as a
                  representative for your brand seriously. I don't smoke, vape, or consume
                  alcohol during weddings. I don't flirt with or hit on guests or members of the
                  wedding party. Most of these statements should be unnecessary, but I've written
                  them because these are all things I've seen at weddings.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong class="font-weight-bold">I'm competent.</strong><br>
                  Not only do I own my professional gear, I know how to use it. I'm a nerd
                  at heart and I'm the guy who reads the manual that comes with my camera. I
                  know about the different focus modes and different metering algorithms, how
                  to shoot manual, how to use a flash (on or off camera), etc. In short, while
                  there are always new things to learn, I'm not a newbie cutting my teeth on
                  your brand's dime.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong class="font-weight-bold">I'm reliable &amp; available.</strong><br>
                  Because I'm no longer a business owner, I'm able to commit to wedding dates
                  well in advance. I'm not going to cancel because an opportunity to book my
                  own event comes along. Also, while it should go without saying, I have reliable
                  transportation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong class="font-weight-bold">I'm not your competition.</strong><br>
                  I love that there is a spirit of community and mentorship in the wedding photography
                  community, but I also know sometimes it can feel like you're training your competition
                  when using a second shooter. As I've stated, my days as a business owner
                  actively pursuing my own wedding commissions are over and I don't need photos
                  from your weddings to build my portfolio.

                <p class="font-weight-light">
                  When I was a lead photographer, I would tell my clients that I had enough
                  gear and backup gear that if something broke, they wouldn't know it. I see
                  that as my responsibility as a wedding photographer.
                </p>
                <p class="font-weight-light">
                  I shoot on Nikon D800 cameras. I always bring at least two with me to
                  weddings. When shooting photos, I always shoot on two memory cards at a time
                  in order to create a realtime backup. All of my lenses are genuine Nikon
                  lenses. I have primes (35 f/1.4, 50 & 85 f/1.8), zooms (24-70 &
                  70-200 f/2.8 (two of each)), and a macro lens (105 f/2.8).
                </p>
                <p class="font-weight-light">
                  In addition to cameras and lenses, I have pretty much any accessory I can
                  imagine needing at a wedding: flashes, remote triggers, tripods, monopods,
                  spare batteries, video light, etc. Like a boy scout, I believe in always
                  being prepared.
