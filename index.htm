                In short, I'm a retired wedding photographer who still loves photographing weddings.
                In the past, I've had my own businesses, both as a solo shooter and as part of a
                husband and wife team. I always enjoyed actually photographing weddings, but I did
                not enjoy running my own photography business, so I've put that behind me.

              <p class="font-weight-light">
                I'm a husband and father of two. During the week I work as an IT manager. I'm a
                nerd at heart and a self-taught photographer.

              <p class="font-weight-light">
                In all my years of photographing weddings, one of the things I've learned is that
                weddings and love come in many flavors. I've had the privilege of photographing
                weddings from many different cultures, various religions (or no religion at all),
                and for people whose sexuality doesn't fit into binary norms. I consider it a
                privilege to have had the opportunity to document these weddings. I personally don't
                believe in discrimination based on culture, religion (or lack thereof), or sexuality.
                If your business limits wedding commissions based on any of those things, please don't
                contact me to shoot for you. I will not work for a business whose values are opposite
                my own.

              <h4 class="mt-3"><img class="icon mr-2" src="img/checklist.svg" />Why Hire Me?</h4>
              <p class="font-weight-light">
                Finding the right second shooter can be difficult. Here are some reasons why I believe
                you may want to hire me:
              </p>
              <ol class="font-weight-light">
                <li>
                  <strong>I'm experienced.</strong><br>
                  I've photographed well over 100 weddings. I've run photography businesses
                  as an independent solo shooter and as part of a husband and wife team. I've
                  shot in just about any situation imagineable at a wedding and I know how to
                  handle myself.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>I'm competent.</strong><br>
                  I know my gear. I know when to use different VR modes on my lenses. I can
                  explain the different focus modes on my camera. I can shoot in natural light
                  or I can light a scene with a flash, strobe, or video light. It goes back
                  to point #1: I'm experienced and I know what I'm doing.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>I'm reliable.</strong><br>
                  I take weddings seriously and don't feel any less responsible as a second
                  shooter than I would as a primary shooter or business owner. I have reliable
                  transportation and backup equipment.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>I'm available.</strong><br>
                  Because I'm no longer a business owner, I have very flexible availability. I
                  work a traditional job during the week, but weekends are free. Because I'm not
                  booking jobs on my own, I don't have a problem committing to dates well in
                  advance.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>I'm professional.</strong><br>
                  In addition to having professional equipment, I understand the important of
                  professional dress and demeanor on a wedding day. I can't believe some of the
                  behavior I've seen from other professionals at weddings. You'll never see me
                  smoking or consuming alcohol at a wedding. I'm friendly, but I'm also married
                  and not looking to score a date.

                <p class="font-weight-light">
                  I believe in coming to a wedding prepared for just about any situation.
                  My kit is based around Nikon D800 full-frame cameras and Nikon lenses. I
                  have a variety of prime lenses (35mm/50mm/85mm) and zoom lenses
                  (24-70mm/70-200mm). I also have a macro lens (105mm).
                </p>
                <p class="font-weight-light">
                  In addition to cameras and lenses, I have all the other gear I believe
                  is necessary for photographing weddings. I shoot on two memory cards at a
                  time. I have speedlights, a strobe, and a video light. I have spare
                  batteries and multiple tripods.
